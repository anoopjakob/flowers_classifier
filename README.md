Using Machine Learning to build an Image classifer to detect  a particular flower from 102 types(output layer has 102 nodes) of flowers using Pytorch.
This project uses an existing pretrained model to access the features like vgg11 ,vgg16, resnet etc..
I built and trained the classifier of the model for my needs.
coded it to work on both CPU and GPU. 
Enjoy..
